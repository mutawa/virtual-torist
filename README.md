# virtual-tourist
==

This is my first project to utilize github.

The aim of this proeject is to display a map for the user where he/she can select a location on the map, and then an annotation is added. If the user selects the annotation, Flicker API is invoked and a number of images from that location is loaded. The result images along with the annoation is stored in Core Data for persistance.

The user should be able to show more photos if desired, and the annotation can be deleted along with all of its images.
